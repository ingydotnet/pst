  language_description="\
D, also known as dlang, is a multi-paradigm system programming language
created by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001. Andrei
Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it
originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is a profoundly different language
â€” features of D can be considered streamlined and expanded-upon ideas from
C++, however D also draws inspiration from other high-level programming
languages, notably Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.
