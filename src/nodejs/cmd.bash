Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside
a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.
Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web
page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
