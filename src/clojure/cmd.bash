  language_description="\
Clojure is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the
approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an
efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. Clojure
is a compiled language, yet remains completely dynamic â€“ every feature
supported by Clojure is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access
to the Java frameworks, with optional type hints and type inference, to
ensure that calls to Java can avoid reflection.
