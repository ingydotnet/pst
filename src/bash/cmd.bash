Bash is the GNU Project's shellâ€”the Bourne Again SHell. This is an
sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell
(ksh) and the C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX
P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional
improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition,
most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification.
