Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a
gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of
JavaScript in a simple way.  The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: \"Itâ€™s just
JavaScript.\" The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there
is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript
library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output
is readable, pretty-printed, and tends to run as fast or faster than the
equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
